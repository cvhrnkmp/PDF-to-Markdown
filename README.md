# PDF-to-Markdown

Welcome to the **PDF to Markdown Converter** repository! This project employs the capabilities of [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to efficiently process PDF documents and convert them into Markdown files. The repository demonstrates a lightweight and straightforward solution to extracting the text and structure from PDFs, while maintaining compatibility with Markdown syntax. Furthermore the repository shows the devoloping path of the code.

## Why Use PyMuPDF?

When it comes to converting PDFs into Markdown, many modern approaches, for instance [Docling](https://github.com/docling/docling), offer advanced features such as the management of tables, images, and mathematical equations. However, such tools often misinterpret document structures, for example mistaking headings for instances, which is a common issue.

**PyMuPDF**, on the other hand, provides a simpler and more precise method for:

- Extracting text and preserving the logical structure.
- Avoiding common misinterpretations of headings and other document components through logical processing.
- Offering a reliable baseline for further manual adjustments and processing.

While PyMuPDF has its limitations, such as no or less robust handling of:

- **Tables**
- **Images**
- **Mathematical equations**

it excels in producing a clean, text-based Markdown representation of PDF content that serves as a practical foundation for further refinement.

## Features

- **Accurate Text Extraction**: Extracts plain text with headings and basic formatting.
- **Markdown Conversion**: Converts PDF content directly into Markdown syntax for easy editing and use.
- **Customizable Processing**: Allows users to extend or adjust functionality to meet specific needs through traceable developement path.

## Limitations

While this tool is effective for text-based PDFs, it has some limitations:

1. **Tables**: Basic table structures may not be preserved or accurately converted.
2. **Images**: Image content is not extracted or embedded in the output.
3. **Mathematical Equations**: Complex equations are not parsed and accurately converted.

These limitations are intrinsic to PyMuPDFâ€™s focus on text extraction, making it best suited for text-heavy documents.

## When to Use This Tool

This repository is ideal for:

- Converting textual PDFs into Markdown for use in blogs, documentation, or content pipelines.
- Working with documents where the structure and content are more important than complex formatting or visual elements.
- Users who require a straightforward and reliable tool with minimal overhead.
